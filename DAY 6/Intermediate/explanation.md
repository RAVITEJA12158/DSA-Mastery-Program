First cereate an boolean arrayif n+1 so that it contains 1 to n numbers
make all those as true;
now run the loop from i=4 because below are always prime
while running check the i is divisible by number 2 ,3.... upto sqrt of n
if it is then itis not prime so false
else true
last,print the numbers containg true
