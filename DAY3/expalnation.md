An unsorted array is taken and this insertion makes sure til where i run berfore that all are sorted
the for loop runs from i=1 to n and j be variable for below i and key taht store the a[i]
it comapre first contaiinedd j>=0 and compares whether the key is is less than a[j]
that means it replaces the a[j+1] with that a[j]
repeates and at last a[j+1] will be key
