First, the program asks you how many numbers you wanna enter. That number is saved in n.
Then it makes an array (basically a list with n empty slots).
Next, it keeps asking you one by one: “enter the number” and fills up the array with whatever you type.
Now comes the sorting part. It looks at two neighbors at a time. If the left one is bigger than the right one, it swaps them.
It keeps doing this again and again, and each round pushes the biggest number to the end (like bubbles rising to the top, that’s why it’s called bubble sort).
After a few rounds, everything is in order from smallest to biggest.
Finally, it just prints: “Here’s your sorted array” and shows the numbers neatly.
